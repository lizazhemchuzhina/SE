# ML logs analyzer
## Introduction
ML logs analyzer can be used for real-time monitoring of your project's logs in order to detect any changes and prevent 
failures in the future. 

## Background
### Why?
We want to know if a project is about to break down before it actually happens.
### How?
Monitor logs, analyze them, notice any significant changes.
### What can you do with ML logs analyzer?
1. Your logs are monitored in real-time, and you are notified whenever there are any changes that might indicate a 
failure.
2. You are provided with the selected logs and failure type prediction.
3. You can store the history of your project's break-downs and assign team roles to configure notifications.
